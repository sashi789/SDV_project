                            <h3>Budget vs. Revenue Relationship</h3>
                            <p>Our analysis revealed that while higher budgets generally correlate with higher revenues, the relationship is not strictly linear. Mid-budget films often show better return on investment (ROI) than big-budget blockbusters. Genre plays a significant role in determining this relationship, with action and sci-fi films typically requiring larger budgets to generate proportional returns.</p>

                            <p>Animation, documentary, and adventure genres consistently receive higher average ratings across viewer segments. Horror and thriller genres show the most polarized ratings, suggesting these genres appeal strongly to specific audience niches rather than general audiences.</p>

                            <p>Movie popularity metrics have evolved significantly over the decades. We observed a general increase in average ratings since 2000, potentially indicating improved production quality or changes in audience rating behavior. The data also shows a clear shift in genre preferences over time, with sci-fi and superhero films gaining significant market share since 2008.</p>

                            <p>While English-language films dominate in terms of quantity and global reach, our analysis identified several non-English language films that achieved exceptional international success. Korean, Spanish, and French-language films have shown particularly strong crossover appeal in recent years.</p>

                    <p>While our analysis provides valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The dataset primarily covers commercial releases and may underrepresent independent and international cinema</li>
                        <li>Historical data before 1990 is less comprehensive and may contain more inaccuracies</li>
                        <li>Budget and revenue figures are not adjusted for regional economic differences</li>
                        <li>User ratings may be subject to selection bias, as they represent only those viewers motivated to provide ratings</li>
                        <li>The analysis does not account for marketing expenditures, which significantly impact commercial performance</li>
